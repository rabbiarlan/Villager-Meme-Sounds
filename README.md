## Download

This pack comes as **two separate ZIP files**. You need **both** for the full experience:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `..._RESOURCEPACK.zip` | Provides the actual snore audio files |
| `..._DATAPACK.zip` | Makes villagers snore repeatedly + adds player snoring |

> ⚠️ **The Resource Pack alone gives villagers one snore when lying down. The Datapack adds continuous snoring every 4 seconds and also makes YOUR character snore. Both together = full experience.**

---

## How to Install

### Step 1 — Resource Pack
1. Download `..._RESOURCEPACK.zip`
2. **Do NOT unzip it**
3. Move it to: `.minecraft/resourcepacks/`
   - Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks\`
   - Linux: `~/.minecraft/resourcepacks/`
4. In Minecraft: **Options → Resource Packs**
5. Find it in the **left column** → click the **arrow →** to move it to the right
6. Drag it to the **very top** of the right column
7. Click **Done**

### Step 2 — Datapack *(optional but recommended)*
1. Download `..._DATAPACK.zip`
2. **Do NOT unzip it**
3. Move it into your specific world's folder: `saves/[your world name]/datapacks/`
4. Open that world and type `/reload` in chat
5. You should see this gold message: **[Snore Pack v1.2_2-alpha] Loaded!**

### Step 3 — Test
- Find a village, wait for night (or `/time set midnight`)
- Stand within **10 blocks** of a sleeping villager
- Make sure **Friendly Creatures** volume is at 100% in sound settings
- Wait up to 4 seconds after villagers lie down

## Supported Versions

**Minecraft Java Edition 1.21 → 26.1.2 and beyond**

> If the resource pack screen shows a warning like *"made for an older/newer version"* — ignore it and enable it anyway. It still works on all listed versions.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| No sound at all | Check that the Resource Pack is in the **Selected (right) column** and at the **top** |
| Resource pack conflict | Move Villager Snoring to the **very top** of selected packs |
| Datapack gold message didn't appear | Double-check the ZIP is inside `saves/[world]/datapacks/` not `.minecraft/resourcepacks/` |
| Villagers not snoring | Make sure they're fully lying down in beds, not just standing near them |
| Only snores once per night | Install the Datapack too — the RP alone only triggers once per sleep |
